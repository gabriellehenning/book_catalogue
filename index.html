        <h3>Sinopse</h3>
        <p>A long time ago Mo decided never to read a book aloud again. 
            His daughter Meggie is a devourer of stories, but despite her insistence, she cannot get her father to read to her in bed. 
            Meggie never understands the reason for this refusal, until an eccentric night visitor finally comes to reveal the secret that explains the ban. It's just that Mo has a strange and uncontrollable ability: when he reads a text aloud, the words come to life in his mouth, and things and beings in the story appear as if by magic. 
            One fateful night, when Meggie was still a baby, Mo's enchanted tongue brought to life some characters in a book called Inkheart. 
            One of them is Capricorn, a cruel and merciless villain, who did not insist on returning to the history from which he came and preferred to settle in an abandoned village. From this dismal place, he commands a gang of thugs who spread terror across the region, carrying out robberies and murders. 
            Capricorn wants to use Mo's powers to bring out of Inkheart a being even more terrible and bloodthirsty than himself. When her henchmen finally kidnap Mo, Meggie will have to face these bizarre and suffering creatures from a world completely different from her own.

        <h3>Sinopse</h3>
        <p>
            At last, one of the most talked-about novels of last year is now available in an accessible mass-market edition. Twelve-year-old Artemis is a millionaire, a genius-and above all, a criminal mastermind. But Artemis doesn't know what he's taken on when he kidnaps a fairy, Captain Holly Short of the LEPrecon Unit. These aren't the fairies of the bedtime stories-they're dangerous!
